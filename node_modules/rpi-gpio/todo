interrupts - look at epoll usage here for gpio: https://github.com/fivdi/onoff/blob/master/onoff.js
do we need to pull up/down pins on setup to avoid false interrupts?
auto-configure? bulk setup?
emit error events?

useful info:
* http://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/usage/gpio/README.md
GPIO pin numbering system where pin 1 is top left (with the SD card slot at the top), and the pins are counted across and down. The pins in the vertical column on the left are odd-numbered, those in the right column even-numbered, with pin 26 bottom right.
